# Data-Science-Project-3
**Face Mask Detection Project**
**Overview**
This project aims to develop a robust model for detecting the presence of face masks in images. The solution involves collecting and preprocessing a dataset, developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, leveraging transfer learning, and fine-tuning the model for optimal performance. The model is evaluated using various metrics to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
**Tasks and Methodology**
**Data Collection and Preprocessing**
**1.	Collection**

o	Gather a comprehensive dataset with images labeled to indicate whether a face mask is present or absent.
o	Sources can include public datasets, web scraping, or manually labeled images.

**2.	Preprocessing**

o	Resize Images: Standardize image sizes to ensure consistency.
o	Normalize Pixel Values: Scale pixel values to a range of 0-1.
o	Data Augmentation: Apply techniques such as rotation, zoom, and flipping to increase dataset variability and improve model generalization.

**Model Development and Architecture**

1.	CNN Design
o	Design a Convolutional Neural Network architecture optimized for feature extraction and classification.
o	Layers may include convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers.
2.	Transfer Learning
o	Utilize pre-trained models such as VGG16 or ResNet50 to leverage existing feature extraction capabilities.
o	Implement transfer learning by using these models as a base and adding custom layers for face mask detection.
3.	Fine-Tuning
o	Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the face mask detection dataset to improve accuracy and performance.

**Model Training**

1.	Training
o	Train the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam optimizer).
2.	Validation
o	Use a validation set to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
o	Implement techniques such as early stopping and learning rate decay for better training stability.

**Model Evaluation**

1.	Metrics
o	Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to understand its performance comprehensively.
2.	Testing
o	Test the model on an unseen test set to assess its real-world performance.
3.	Model Selection
o	Compare various models and select the best one based on the evaluation metrics.

**Hyper-parameter Tuning**

â€¢	Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and architecture-specific parameters to optimize model performance.
